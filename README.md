# IttyBitty
Itty Bitty Locations

app that will help tourists find sights to see wherever they may be.
Use an appropriate API (e.g., Google Places, Yelp, Foursquare, Flickr, etc)
to grab information about 100 interesting locations around the device’s current location.
Plot each location on a map view. Somehow display information about each location
when the user selects the location.
Beginning at the devices current location, draw a route that connects all the locations together
and ends back at the current location. Don’t bore your tourist by visiting any location twice.
Don’t make your tourist too tired by making the length of the connecting path
any longer than is necessary.

The app is targeting Android 5.0 and above.
